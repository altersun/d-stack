    <h1>Welcome to Donnybrook</h1>
    <h2>Donnywhatnow??</h3>
    <p>
        ⚫ A Donnybrook is a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/donnybrook">public brawl</a>. 
        It's also the name of the street I live(d?) on when I made this.
    </p>
    <h2>Who are you?</h3>
    <p>
        ⚫ I'm David, a <i>mostly</i> embedded software/firmware developer. I made this website because I
        never made one before and figured I should try. Until now most of my work has been bare-metal C
        on microcontrollers, C++ and Python on Linux (both embedded and desktop), and a few others like bash, 
        GNU make, lua, moonscript, protocol buffers...enough that I still feel like I'm forgetting something.
        And yet, I never made a proper website before. 
    </p>
    <h2>So do you just code all day?
    </h2>
    <p>
        ⚫ Nah, that'd be boring. Part of the fun of embedded is working with a bunch of people who <i>don't</i>
        do what you do. Working with electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, UX folk, biologists, 
        audioligists, even registered nurses! I love the flow of ideas from all the disciplines working
        on a project as we bring it to life. I've worked on robots, consumer recording equipment, hearing aids 
        and heart pumps and they've all been great experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
        ⚫ ...and between you and me, I'm far enough along that I've been mentoring engineers who got into 
        the business after me. Nothing much more rewarding than passing on the tech skills and professional 
        practices I've gained from those before me onto those after.
    </p>
    <p>
        ⚫ Please remind me to make a writeup of all learnings from about philosophies about being
         in management. It's a topic I like discussing.
