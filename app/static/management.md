# Management
There's more ways to be a bad manager than a good one. 

## Expectations of the Team
I have three general expecations any colleague, direct report or not:
1. Get your work done well and on-time
2. Be available for your colleagues and customers
3. Get along with your colleagues and customers

...but that's all pretty vague so I'll break it down

### Get your work done well and on-time
The work needs to happen. The best way a manager can set up a direct report for getting their work done is to make sure they have a clear (definition of "done")[https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-definition-done] is, which is a valuable concept popularized by agile. Further, it should be written down, ideally somewhere where it's easy to go back and check, like in a ticketing system or wiki page. Before a direct report starts, it can help to check that they have everything they think they need, be it tool, skills, or info.
