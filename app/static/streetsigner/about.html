<p>Since I named my domain after the street I lived on, I figured a street sign graphic on the website would be appropriate. So I went looking for a street sign image generator online, but everything I found online either required some kind of log-in or didn't have any templates <em>remotely</em> resembling my local street signs. So...I made my own,</p>
<h2>From scratch??</h2>
<p>Kind of...honestly the image generator at the core of this is based on the <a href="https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow">Python Image Library (or PILlow)</a> and from a script generated based on ChatGPT scripts. My <strong>bespoke</strong> contributions are doing all the python, docker, and nginx glue to make the image generation available via a website. </p>
<p>Having worked on the <a href="http://www.donnybrook.boston/sevenball">Spritual Seven Ball</a> already helped a lot, since in the process I learned how to serve image content via websockets.</p>
<h3>Methodology</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Streetsigner is hosted in a <a href="sanic.dev">Sanic</a> app</li>
<li>All street signs are drawn at time of request by the server via the <a href="https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow">Python Imaging Library</a></li>
<li>The client's browser and the server use a websocket for requests and sending images. Because a websocket is used, the work can be done server-side instead of client-side and no further page loads are required.</li>
</ul>
